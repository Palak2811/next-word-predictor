# Next Word Predictor

A simple **LSTM-based** next word prediction project built with Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  
The model predicts the next word in a sequence based on the training text (*Hamlet* by William Shakespeare).

## ðŸš€ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Palak2811/next-word-predictor.git
   cd next-word-predictor


Create and activate a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸ›  Usage
1. Run the prediction script
python app.py


The script will prompt you to enter a sequence of words.

The model will predict and display the next word.

Example:

Enter your text: To be or not to
Predicted next word: be

ðŸ““ Training the Model

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook experiemnts.ipynb


The notebook contains:

Data loading (hamlet.txt)

Tokenization and preprocessing

LSTM model creation

Training and saving the model + tokenizer

ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Main libraries:

tensorflow

numpy

pickle

jupyter

Install everything from:

pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Source: Hamlet by William Shakespeare (public domain)

The dataset is small and mainly for demonstration purposes.
For better results, train on a larger text corpus.
